Smaf '15 Puzzle' React App
=====================

This is a Smaf demo app for the popular 15 puzzle game, created with the React.js library and the Smaf SDK.
 
The app demonstrates the cross-device remote (keyboard) handling.

By pressing the 'UP', 'DOWN', 'LEFT' and 'RIGHT' buttons on your TV remote (or your mobile/desktop keyboard) you can change the active cell and by pressing 'ENTER' you can swap its position with the "blank" cell.
 
You can also experience the cross-device handling of the "colored" keys, such as the 'RED' and 'GREEN' keys. By pressing these keys you can restart the game (at a different difficulty level each).
